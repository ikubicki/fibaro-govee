# Govee QuickApp

Integration for Govee lightning products

## Configuration

`ApiKey` - Govee API key

`DeviceID` - Govee device ID. It's a composition identifier, built from a SKU and a realt value of device ID, separated by a dot. 

### Optional values

`Interval` - number of minutes defining how often data should be refreshed. This value will be automatically populated on initialization of quick application.

`Debug` - once set, application logs will be more verbose.

## Installation

Download the fqa file and install through Fibaro Home Center UI. Once installed configure the `ApiKey`. Then click on `List devices` button. Open logs for the installed application and pick proper device ID from the logs.

## Support

Due to horrible user experience with Fibaro Marketplace, for better communication I recommend to contact with me through GitHub or create an issue in the repository.
